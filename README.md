## Buffering audio clip recorder

Recorda is a browser based app that records audio to a buffer up to four hours long. It works on laptops, phones and tablets. When there's a chunk you might want to keep then select it in the timeline and it is clipped out and added to a list of clips. If you want to save that chunk to disk just click the save button and you will be offered a download.
