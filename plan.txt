Audio quality for voice is passable but pretty bad for music
  Seemingly this is because by default google processes it first unless instructed otherwise
    doing things like noise suppression and echo removal
  apparently these "constraints" can be added or removed via an constraints object passed to the guM constructor


Allow recording deletion
  remove from recordings
    index.html needs a delete button
    app needs a event_handler for that button
      that handler asks recorder to delete id wevs then call refresh
        by passing in refresh as a callback

make custom audio tag controller/display as stock one cannot be meaningfully styled and looks ugly as owt.

Use webworker for WAV file creation
Save all recordings to zip
Separation of audio from dom:
    need to mock window.URL.createObjectURL(WAVFileBlob or whatever)
    Alternatively
      make sure it isn't called
        by adding additional logic to function saveStateExecute(arg)?
    Or deal with the consequence of undefined down the line?
    Or make it a fancy undefined?
      http://window.URL.not.present.so.no.URL.for.you.buddy
    We only need it in the views no?
      And the views don't need actual data to test
        so if we even bother testing them we can mock the input there
      We might need to test the view builder though
      But is that a problem if it just doesn't have a url property
DONE-------------------------

Prepend a nice human readable date to the file name
Split recording list renderer into views - SORT OF!
Add playback to each recording list entry
Add save functionality
Refactor to eliminate anon functions, they can make profiling and debugging awkward
  All functions should have names!
