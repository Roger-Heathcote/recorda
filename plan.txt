DONE-------------------------

Fixed chrome pasthorugh issue

Allow recording deletion

Come up with better uuid ssytem than just using timestamps!

Get dataDisplay actually working

put all views in a views file
where to put all the click handlers? Left in app.js for now

Move views out of recorder, leaving only viewModels inside

Redesign constraint handling
  constraints = new OptionalAudioConstraintsClass();
  present simpler api with our own group names
     group name maps to list of canonical and prefixed versions of the same thing
     e.g. NoiseSuppression => mozNoiseSuppression, googNoiseSuppression, etc

Added rudimentary clip detection.
Investigate way of getting HQ line in!
Prepend a nice human readable date to the file name
Split recording list renderer into views - SORT OF!
Add playback to each recording list entry
Add save functionality
Refactor to eliminate anon functions, they can make profiling and debugging awkward
  All functions should have names!



LONG TERM--------------------------------------------------------------

  Investigate effect of individual audio constraints on voice and music
    Until API is better implemented in the browsers this would be unproductively slow
    Disabling all by default gives best quality on my music PC so I guess I'll just
    await the day the toggles seem to do something

  Re-applying constraints live
    Firefox "seems" to permit constraints to be applied after the fact
      Though I've yet to find one that seems to have any effect
    Chrome 35 has to have them specified up front
      but they do seem to have an effect
    Look into constraints in webkit browsers, safari etc

  Use webworker for WAV file creation
    Not at all straightforward!
    Main array is an array of arraybuffers
      but if we "transfer" them we lose access to them which we can't have
      AND
      if we copy them in one block then for big selections
        we will block the event loop for too long which is exactly what we are trying to avoid
        even without the display portion active this may still block the scriopt processor and cause glitches
    Possible solution
      when an outpoint is set
        dimension a new fixed width array and write the wav header
          then copy the data over a bit at a time til it's done.
        BUT
          As it stands we would only be able to save a single recording at a time
            as if we returned from saved to buffering state we might trim needed elements
        ALSO
          Can we run without get animation frame?


    Also save all/selected recordings to zip

  Separation of audio from dom:
      need to mock window.URL.createObjectURL(WAVFileBlob or whatever)
      Alternatively
        make sure it isn't called
          by adding additional logic to function saveStateExecute(arg)?
      Or deal with the consequence of undefined down the line?
      Or make it a fancy undefined?
        http://window.URL.not.present.so.no.URL.for.you.buddy
      We only need it in the views no?
        And the views don't need actual data to test
          so if we even bother testing them we can mock the input there
        We might need to test the view builder though
        But is that a problem if it just doesn't have a url property

  make custom audio tag controller/display as stock one cannot be meaningfully styled and looks ugly as owt.

  Make a chrome/firefox app!
  To use getUserMedia() in an installable app (for example, a Firefox OS app), you need to specify one or both of the following fields inside your manifest file:
    "permissions": {
      "audio-capture": {
        "description": "Required to capture audio using getUserMedia()"
      },
      "video-capture": {
        "description": "Required to capture video using getUserMedia()"
      }
    }
